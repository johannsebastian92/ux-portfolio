<!-- Problem -->
  <div class="container2">
    <h2 class="title yeseva-h2">Problem</h2>
    <p>Whenever you open up the news, there are countless articles on the difficulties of everyday people with their finances.
      In 2018, outstanding student loan debt totals 1.5 trillion dollars.
      As of 2019, the average US household has an estimated credit card balance of $6,849.
      Yet in a recent poll done by debt.com, results found that 1 out of 3 Americans don’t use a budget.
      The following case study seeks to understand the deeper issues people have with money in order to create a product that can assist in this crisis.

            <h2 class="title yeseva-h2">User Research</h2>
              <p>My approach to understand users was to start with surveys.
                The construction of the user survey has a focus on personal finance.
                It helped me understand how they view themselves, what issues they are facing, as well as their financial goals.
                Below are the averages of the responses given by the participants:
              </p>

        <!-- Key Insights -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="title"><strong>Key Insights</strong></h3>
            <p>The survey revealed that participants in some form or another struggle with money.
              Although they have goals pertaining to either saving money or paying off debt, participants have a modest outlook on their finances as 50% of participants rated themselves a 6 or lower on a scale of 1 to 10.
              And when looking at their abilities in managing money, the average score given is in the C+ or B- range.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The one underlying issue that all these problems encompass is that participants use ineffective budgeting methods as approximately 40% of participants use a personal system to manage their finances but still struggle with issues that prevent them from achieving their financial goals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Users need a simple and effective budgeting tool that allows users to create goals, manage money, and make wiser decisions. </p>

            <p>After completing the user survey and identifying the main issues users have with their finances.
              I conducted a competitive analysis which revealed the key strengths and opportunities as well as the threats and weaknesses of the market.

          <p>The initial research conducted bore 3 user personas.
            With those personas came an understanding of what their goals, pain points, situation, and motivations are.
            The three personas are:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Millennial burdened by student loans</li>
            <li>2. College student getting stated with money</li>

            <p>User personas gave me a broad sense of who my users are and what motivates them. But in order to get a  deeper understanding of their worldview, I created an empathy map. The question I asked myself when filling out each section of the map is <strong>“What made them want an app like this?”</strong></p>

           <p>With an understanding of who I am designing the product for and their goals and pain points.
             I created 5 user stories that are the MVP of my product and go to the heart of my persona’s issues.

      <!--Wireframes -->
        <div class="container3">
          <h4 class="title"><strong>Wireframes</strong></h4>
            <p>Before starting on my wireframes, additional research was needed. Because my product deals with people’s finances,
              I wanted to be sure that I was asking for the appropriate information.
              As a result, for each key feature of my product - I went to other personal finance and banking products and took notes on what, how, and when they ask for information.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>With the sitemap, user flows, and necessary content in hand, I began to sketch each feature of my product.
              Once I was satisfied with which iteration to move forward with, I translated them into low fidelity digital wireframes on Figma.
            </p>

         <p>Earlier in the competitive analysis, I noted how the tone of the content of products in the market is a weakness. I say this because user research shows that finances is a source of stress for many people. And with that in mind, I knew I wanted Worth to have the following characteristics:.

         <p>The logo consists of an icon and a wordmark.
           The icon is a character meditating as a coin which takes the place of the letter “O” in the wordmark.
           The logo is meant to represent peace of mind when it comes to one’s finances.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Logo should be white in a dark background and dark gunmetal on lighter backgrounds.</p>

          <p><strong>Playfair Display</strong> serif typeface is well-suited for headlines and titles with a contemporary feeling that will give designs the sophistication they need. </p>

          <p><strong>Dark Gunmetal</strong> and <strong>Green Blue</strong> is serious and conveys the importance of finances and a person’s goals.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Radical Red, </strong><strong>Mountain Meadow, </strong> and <strong>Deep Saffron </strong>gives the brand a friendly and inviting feeling.</p>

<!-- Mockup Feedback -->
  <div class="container2">
    <h2 class="title yeseva-h2">Feedback</h2>
      <p>With the wireframes and branding completed, I created the first set of mockups and asked other designers for feedback</p>
      <br>
      <img class="desktop-only feedback image-spacing" src="./images/worth-images/desktop-mockup-feedback.svg" alt="Mockup Feedback">
      <img class="mobile-only feedback image-spacing" src="./images/worth-images/mobile-mockup-feedback.svg" alt="Mockup Feedback">

    <div class=container3>
      <h3 class="title"><strong>Key Insights</strong></h3>
      <p>The main feedback that I recieved from other designers is about the onboarding process and how it will cause dropoff within users.
        In my first draft of mockups, once the user creates an account they go straight into an onboarding process that will set the application up as seen above.
        This is where the dropoff may occur.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>As a result of the feedback, I removed the onboarding process and added empty states to the goals, accounts, and budget pages.
        From there, the users will be able to set up each part of the application.

        <h4 class="title"><strong>Usability Testing</strong></h4>
          <p>With the wireframes completed and brand inputted into the design, it was not time to test  the mockups.
          The tasks that were tested are: </p>
          <br>
          <!-- Tasks -->
          <ul>
            <li>1. Creating a budget</li>

            <li>4. Turning on the round up feature</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>My selection thought process for the participants was to choose individuals who matched my user personas.
            This allows for efficient feedback of the product. With that in mind, the participants are:</p>
          <br>
          <!-- Participants -->
          <ul>
            <li>1. 24 year old undergrad student who works as an after school mentor</li>

          <p>With regards to attaining feedback, I asked questions and took notes during 3 points: </p>
          <br>
          <p><u><strong>Pre-Test</strong></u>: Which focused on demographics and the participants relationship with money</p><br>
          <p><u><strong>Post-Task</strong></u>: Where I took notes on the completion task time and asked users two questions; on a scale of 1 to 5, how difficult was it to complete the task?
            As well “What motivated them to take this path?”</p><br>
          <p><u><strong>Post-Test</strong></u>: This questionnaire focused on the user’s overall experience with the product, what they liked, and what didn’t.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Results -->
      <div class="container3">
        <h4 class="title"><strong>Results</strong></h4>
          <p>The charts below show the average results of the numbers provided by the users.</p>

        <h4 class="title"><strong>Key Insights</strong></h4>
          <p>When looking at the numbers, participants found completing each task easy.
            When asked to rate each task (5 being the easiest, 1 being the most difficult), there was no score under 4.3 out 5 for the tasks starting a budget and setting a goal.
            In order to confirm the user’s rating, I also recorded task times.
            If the task time matches the rating given, I can deem that rating valid.
            With this in mind, the recorded task times affirm the ratings given by the participants.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>In the second part of analyzing the data, I looked over user interviews to find areas that can be improved but also areas where things should be kept the same.
            The comments below are just a couple in the conversations that I used to improve the overall product.
          </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="title"><strong>"What did you like most about using the product?"</strong></h3>
          <br>
          <p>“I really liked how some of the information was presented.
            I thought the important information was present… I also liked the charts that were used.
            I feel like at a quick glance I can really understand where I am for the month.”</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="title"><strong>"Did you find anything difficult or caused you frustration with the product?"</strong></h3>
          <br>
          <p>“Although the words are easy to understand. I feel like some things can be described better by using different words or icons.
            Like the home page and buttons. When you get to the actual home section it’s more like a budget page.
            But you already have a budget page too. So that can be kind of confusing…
            The words in the goals section can be said better too.
            I noticed that for the savings goal, it didn’t even ask me how much I need to save a month.”</p>

<!-- Conclusion -->
  <div class="container2">
    <h2 class="title yeseva-h2">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Creating a product that helps people get control of their finances has always been an aspiration for me.
        And to be able to speak to users - understand their concerns, goals, and what drove them and use that research to construct Worth was largely a success.
      </p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="title"><strong>What worked?</strong></h4>
      <p>All in all I believe that the major issues that users had with their finances which arose in the research is addressed in this product.
        The budget method is simple and effective. Connecting accounts allow users to track their expenses in real-time.
        Allowing users to create goals helps them keep track of what they want.
        And the round up feature allows users to find extra money to pay off debt or spend for themselves.
      </p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="title"><strong>If I had more time…</strong></h4>
      <p>Creating goals when it comes to money can be complicated.
        There are so many options and variables to consider.
        The interest rate, fees, and mortgage are just some things to consider.
        If I had more time, I would have developed the goals feature of this application by continuing my research.
        Asking users questions like; “What kind of goals do you have”? As well as figure out what variables go into that goal.
      </p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="title"><strong>At the end of the day…</strong></h4>
      <p>Worth solves the inherent problem the research presented to me.
        Which was that users need a system.
        A system where it provides the necessities of achieving their financial goals.
        Worth allows users to take control of their finances regardless of their level.
        Worth takes a complicated subject that resonates stress in many people and gives them an opportunity to achieve peace of mind.
