            <p>After performing a SWOT analysis I was able to identify the key opprotunity. The solution is to live up to values that encourages individuals to create amazing projects.</p>
            <p>Just like the survey, the competitive analysis confirms that the prices of subscriptions are the main issue. By utilizing the “Freeium” model, which is a pricing strategy where a product and all its features are free of charge; allows the user to switch and use Nimbus without feeling the pressure to purchase subscriptions. Thus encouraging users to use the product frequently</p>

            <p>Once the data has been analyzed and the personas have been created, I utilized the Pareto Principle to create high priority user stories. Meaning that 80% of the product’s users, use 20% of the features. These stories were translated into user flows to best show how the user would execute each task. Both artifacts ensure that the project stays within a consistent scope.</p>

          <p>Metrics indicate that users were very familar with how Nimbus worked . For each task there was 100% completion rate for all participants and low task time indicates users understood how the product functioned. </p>
          <h3>Language</h3>
          <p>The main issue that users had when asked about their experience was the language used. 'Sign In' and 'Sign Up' looked similar with at a glance. And in the homepage, words like 'Home', and 'Files' were vague and could have used more contrast. </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>From ideation to completion, Nimbus has undergone many different changes. I was able to take an indefinite idea without a target audience, product name or brand, or even a problem and ended with a well-defined solution. Nimbus offers an alternative to other cloud storage apps by taking the main issue users have with the competition and directly addressing that. </p>

        <section class="reflection">
          <h1>Reflection</h1>
          <p>With the benefit of hindsight, I would have allocated more time into developing features that I believe would have separated Nimbus from the competition. User surveys indicated a smaller but third target audience. A target audience that uses cloud storage services for personal uses. </p>
          <p>Developing features for this target audience would have required more time allocated to research and figure out what their hobbies are and how it relates to their usage of cloud storage apps. However, due to the time constraint, I decided to focus on the more prominent target audience.</p>
          <p>To create a competitive product it is necessary to perform great research. I would have loved to spend more time interviewing and picking the brain of this third audience.</p>
