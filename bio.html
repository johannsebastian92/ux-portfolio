        <h2 class="bio-header title-spacing">The Beginning</h2>
          <p>From the very beginning, I wanted my life to about helping others.
            The experience of being born in the Philippines and being raised in Guam and seeing the struggles of others gave me such a unique perspective on life.
            These experiences developed a sense of deep understanding and empathy in people that I wanted to harness.
            I remember doing an assignment as a 3rd grader asking me what I wanted to be when I was older and my answer was to become a Doctor.
            Little did I know, that these experiences were just the beginning of my journey towards design.
          </p>

            <br>

          <p>Attending San Francisco State University, I decided to pursue a career in Physical Therapy and as I started to gain experience in the field, something just felt off.
            It became increasingly obvious that this wasn’t the career for me. Although becoming a Physical Therapist matches my values, the methods of getting things done is static and didn’t fulfill this need in me to be innovative.
            See as a kid, I always happiest when I was working with others to get school projects done.
            I was happiest playing games that challenged my ability to solve things like a Rubix Cube or card and video games that put an emphasis on strategy to succeed.
            The spirit of inquiry being in me at an early age where I loved learning different subjects and not just specializing at one thing.
            When I realized becoming a Physical Therapist wasn’t for me, I started to explore other paths.
          </p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="bio-header title-spacing">Lessons Learned in My Journey</h2>
          <p>With each stop in my journey came with it important lessons that inform my approach to design.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="title-spacing2"><strong>Undergraduate Experience</strong></h3>
          <p>Being in an undergrad program so research-based helped me develop into a better scientist.
            I learned how to read complex studies, form hypotheses, test these assumptions, and collect data to be analyzed and presented.
          </p>

        <br>

        <h3 class="title-spacing2"><strong>Personal Trainer</strong></h3>
          <p>I learned how to talk to people and listen to understand their goals, needs, motivations, and issues.
            I used those conversations to create great experiences for my clients.
            This path helped develop my ability to create plans as this process was ongoing and continually evolving based on the client’s needs.
            My keys to success here: empathy, prioritization, and continued collaboration.
          </p>


        <br>

        <h3 class="title-spacing2"><strong>Start-Up Companies</strong></h3>
          <p>Working in smaller companies tested my ability to wear different hats.
            To understand different facets of the company in order to assist wherever needed.
            I learned how to collaborate with other departments to bring projects to life that push the company’s goals.
            It was also in these settings that I realized that I wanted more for myself.
          </p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="bio-header title-spacing">Moving Forward...</h2>
          <p>After all these paths and lessons, I enrolled in Bloc’s Designer Apprenticeship program.
            Product Design is the perfect marriage for my curiosity in solving problems and my goal of wanting to help others.
            Through the curriculum and my mentor’s guidance I was able to refocus my skills towards the field of design.
          </p>

        <h2 class="bio-header title-spacing">Photography</h2>
          <p>I am incredibly inspired by traveling.
            The culture, food, architecture and more importantly the people all contribute
            to my creativity and love for learning about others. </p>
